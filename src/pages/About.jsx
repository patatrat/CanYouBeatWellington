            This website is a fun and interactive way to check if today is a day when "you can't beat Wellington" weather-wise. It's based on the popular saying among Wellingtonians that on a good day, "You can't beat Wellington on a good day."
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Here's how it works:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>We fetch real-time weather data for Wellington from a reliable weather API.</li>
            <li>We analyze four key factors: temperature, wind speed, sunnyness, and rainfall.</li>
            <li>Based on predefined thresholds, we determine if today is a day you "can't beat Wellington."</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The thresholds are:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
            <li>Minimum Temperature: 18Â°C</li>
            <li>Maximum Wind Speed: 10 km/h</li>
            <li>Minimum Sunnyness: 90%</li>
            <li>Maximum Rainfall: 0 mm</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If all these conditions are met, it's considered a day when "you can't beat Wellington." Otherwise, it's a day when Wellington can be beaten!
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember, this is all in good fun and meant to celebrate Wellington's famously variable weather. Enjoy your day, whether you can beat Wellington or not!
