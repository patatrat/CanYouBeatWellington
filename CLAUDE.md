# CLAUDE.md — Can You Beat Wellington?

Project tracking, backlog, and architectural decisions.

## Project Overview

A hobby webapp that checks if today's weather in Wellington, NZ is good enough that you "can't beat it". Users can vote agree/disagree. Historical data stored in Supabase, visualised on the About page.

- **Live**: https://canyoubeatwellington.radomski.co.nz/
- **Repo**: https://github.com/patatrat/CanYouBeatWellington
- **Stack**: React 18 + Vite 8 + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Supabase
- **Analytics**: Vercel Analytics
- **Hosting**: Vercel (custom domain via Cloudflare DNS, grey-cloud/DNS-only)
- **Originally built with**: Lovable (formerly GPT Engineer)

## Weather Assessment Rules

A "good day" requires ALL of:
- Max temperature ≥ 18°C
- Max wind speed < 20 km/h
- Daytime rain = 0 mm

Computed at runtime from `rulesStorage.js` — not stored in DB, so rules can change freely.
Data source: Open-Meteo API (free, no key required).

## Infrastructure

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|---------|
| Hosting | Vercel (auto-deploys on push to `main`) |
| Database | Supabase free tier (project: `qumelyuoeutlnnouhguo`) |
| Supabase pause prevention | GitHub Actions cron ping every 5 days |
| Daily weather | GitHub Actions cron at 12:00 UTC daily (`daily-weather.yml`) |
| CI | GitHub Actions — lint + build + audit on every push/PR |
| Secrets | GitHub repo secrets + Vercel env vars (both use `VITE_` prefix) |
| DNS | Cloudflare (DNS-only, grey cloud) → Vercel |

## Backlog

### P2 — Security hardening
- [x] **Add Supabase RLS policies** — SELECT/INSERT for anon; direct UPDATE blocked; votes go via `increment_vote` SECURITY DEFINER function
- [x] **Remove dead Google Analytics code** — replaced with Vercel Analytics

### P3 — Code quality
- [x] Remove unused Radix UI/shadcn components — deleted 43 unused ui files; removed 25 Radix packages + other dead deps; CSS bundle 45 kB → 19 kB
- [x] Move `esbuild` to `devDependencies`
- [x] Add `engines: { node: ">=24" }` to `package.json`
- [x] Fix all ESLint errors blocking CI
- [x] SEO improvements — target phrases in title/meta/structured data, H1 restructure, sitemap
- [x] Upgrade Vite to v8 + plugin-react to v6 — cleared 2 moderate esbuild dev-server vulns; fixed port type (string → number)
- [x] Delete dead one-off migration scripts from `src/utils/` — `populateHistoricalData.js`, `recheckHistoricalData.js`, `sunshineUpdateCheck.js`, `removeSunninessRule.js` were all unreferenced leftovers from earlier DB schema work

### P3.5 — Historical data
- [x] Retrieve pre-2026 weather data — `scripts/backfill-historical.js` uses archive API; triggered via GitHub Actions "Backfill Historical Weather" workflow (2020-01-01 → 2025-12-31). Uses daily `precipitation_sum` (full day, slightly more conservative than daytime-only).

### P4 — Feature improvements
- [x] **Daily weather cron job** — GitHub Actions runs `scripts/populate-db.js` at 12:00 UTC (midnight NZST) daily; upserts idempotently so also backfills any missed days
- [x] Make voting tamper-resistant — `vote_tokens (token, date)` table enforces one vote per browser identity per day at DB level; `increment_vote()` updated to accept `voter_token` arg; unique constraint violation (23505) rejects duplicate votes server-side. Run `scripts/vote-tokens-migration.sql` in Supabase dashboard to activate.
- [ ] Adjust good-day rules to account for seasons — e.g. lower temp threshold in winter; update `rulesStorage.js` when ready
- [x] Staging environment — `staging` branch auto-deploys to Vercel preview URL (`canyoubeatwellington-git-staging-patatrat.vercel.app`); shares production Supabase DB

### P5 — Nice to have
- [ ] Add unit/integration tests (currently zero)
- [x] Set up Dependabot for automated dependency updates — weekly on Mondays, groups dev deps and Radix UI packages
- [x] Update React Router to 7.x — cleared XSS vuln; API unchanged for our usage (`BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, `Link`)

## Decisions Log

| Date | Decision | Reasoning |
|------|----------|-----------|
| 2026-04-09 | Migrate hosting to Vercel | User familiar with Vercel; enables preview deploys natively |
| 2026-04-09 | Supabase: cron ping to prevent pausing | Free solution; no migration needed |
| 2026-04-09 | Remove CSVGen page | One-off seeding tool with hardcoded API key |
| 2026-04-09 | Remove `is_good_day` from DB | Rules may change seasonally; compute at runtime from `rulesStorage.js` |
| 2026-04-09 | Start DB fresh from 90 days | archive-api unreachable from Codespace; retrieve older data locally later |
| 2026-04-09 | Keep Supabase free tier | Pause solved by cron ping; no need to migrate or upgrade yet |
| 2026-04-09 | Staging: use Vercel auto-generated URL, not custom domain | Custom domains require a production deployment; preview URL is stable enough for a hobby project |
| 2026-04-09 | Supabase RLS: block direct UPDATE, use increment_vote() | Prevents anon from overwriting vote counts directly; function is atomic |
| 2026-04-09 | Replace Google Analytics with Vercel Analytics | GA was a placeholder that never worked; Vercel Analytics is zero-config |
| 2026-04-11 | Fix ESLint errors + SEO pass | Unblocked CI; improved discoverability via structured data, H1, and sitemap freshness |
| 2026-04-11 | Upgrade Vite 5 → 8, plugin-react 4 → 6 | Cleared 2 moderate audit vulns; 0 vulnerabilities remaining |
| 2026-04-11 | Backfill historical weather via GitHub Actions | archive-api reachable from GH runners; seeded 2020-01-01 → 2025-12-31 |
| 2026-04-11 | Tamper-resistant voting via vote_tokens table | DB-level dedup without a backend; acceptable for hobby project; requires SQL migration in Supabase dashboard |

## Architecture Notes

### Data flow
1. Page load → Open-Meteo API → today's weather fetched
2. Today's record upserted to Supabase `daily_weather_records`
3. Historical records fetched from Supabase for About page charts/calendar
4. `is_good_day` computed at runtime using `loadRules()` from `rulesStorage.js`
5. Votes stored in localStorage (client-side only) + incremented in Supabase

### Key files
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/utils/weatherStorage.js` | Open-Meteo fetch + localStorage cache |
| `src/utils/rulesStorage.js` | Weather criteria — source of truth for good-day rules |
| `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` | Supabase client (reads from `VITE_` env vars) |
| `src/integrations/supabase/types.ts` | DB types (manually maintained — no `is_good_day`) |
| `scripts/populate-db.js` | Node.js script to seed/refresh weather data (run manually or via daily cron) |
| `vercel.json` | SPA rewrites + cache headers |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Lint + build + audit gate |
| `.github/workflows/supabase-keepalive.yml` | Prevents Supabase free tier from pausing |
| `.github/workflows/daily-weather.yml` | Fetches and stores Wellington weather daily at midnight NZT |
